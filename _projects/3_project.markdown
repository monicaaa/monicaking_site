At Penn I also work as a fellow at the [Graduate Student Center](https://www.facebook.com/GradCenterUPenn/), where I plan, manage, and execute recreational events to engage Penn's 10,000+ grad students. One of my favorite parts of this job is to create promotional materials marketing the events. We use [Canva](www.canva.com) to design the materials. 

Check out my [portfolio of graphics](https://www.dropbox.com/sh/344ku3y3lqzkg7e/AAD5pikQhmpee9I_LNCr-PUva?dl=0). It includes a selection of events I've planned at the Graduate Student Center and also includes graphics I've made for the [Fishtown Neighbors Association](https://www.fishtown.org).
