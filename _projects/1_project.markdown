We often think of "accidents" as random events that happen to unlucky people. In my dissertation research, I'm interested in uncovering patterns in car crashes to show that they are predictable and preventable. 

My recent work debunks previous explanations for why car crashes decrease when the economy gets worse and increase when the economy improves. This paper was published in [Social Science & Medicine](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953616300715), the leading social science health journal, and featured on [Penn News](https://news.upenn.edu/news/penn-research-connects-recession-recovery-commercial-truck-fatalities).
