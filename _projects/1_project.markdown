We often think of "accidents" as random events that happen to unlucky people. For my dissertation research, I uncover patterns in car crashes to show that they are predictable and preventable. 

My recent work investigates the impact of unemployment on motor vehicle deaths. This paper was published in [Social Science & Medicine](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953616300715), the leading social science health journal, and featured on [Penn News](https://news.upenn.edu/news/penn-research-connects-recession-recovery-commercial-truck-fatalities). 

This research sheds light on an unexpected consequence of economic recoveries -- more motor vehicle fatalities from commercial trucks. The main implication is that we need to look into ways to make commercial activities safer on the road. 

Or, to sum it up another way:
