<p> Welcome! 
</p>

<p>I work with data in order to understand the world better and make more informed decisions. Sometimes the data validates what we expect, but it's exciting to find results that do not align with our hypothesis and change the way we think. Check out my project in academic research, consulting, and community organizations. 
</p>

<p>
My toolbox includes cross-sectional and longitudinal surveys, large databases, statistical modeling, programming languages (most used: R, Stata, and constantly learning more), qualitative interviews... and sometimes a Phillips screwdriver can come in handy. 
</p>

<p>I'm in my final year of grad school at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm completing my PhD in Demography and recently received my Masters in Statistics. Iâ€™m originally from Minnesota and now live in the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia with my husband. </p>
