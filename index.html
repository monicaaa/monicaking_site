<p>I enjoy using data to inform decisions by making discoveries that sometimes validate and othertimes challenge our hunches. Check out my projects in academic research, consulting, and community organizations. 
</p>

<p>
My toolbox includes qualitative interviews, one-time and longitudinal surveys, large databases, statistical modeling, programming languages (most used: R, Stata, and constantly learning more)... and sometimes a Phillips screwdriver can come in handy. 
</p>

<p>I'm in my final year of grad school at the University of Pennsylvania, where I'm pursuing a PhD in Demography and MA in Statistics. Iâ€™m originally from Minnesota and now live in the Fishtown neighborhood of Philadelphia with my husband. </p>
